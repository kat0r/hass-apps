## Unreleased

### Fixed

### Security

### Added
* Added new `generic2` actor type which is more flexible than the old `generic`.

### Changed

### Deprecated

### Removed


## 0.7.0 - 2019-12-04

### Fixed
* An overlay will now be applied even when the scheduled value won't change.

### Changed
* Infinite retrying of value sending to an actor is no longer supported, meaning
  `send_retries: -1` is now a configuration error. Use a reasonably high value
  instead if you really need excessive retrying.
* Simplified internal handling of `IncludeSchedule()`. If this causes problems with
  existing configurations, please file an issue.

### Removed
* The previous name `Skip` for the `Next` expression result type has been removed.
* The `OVERLAY_REVERT_ON_NO_RESULT` marker has been removed, it's the default now.


## 0.6.0 - 2019-09-27

### Fixed
* Fixed a regression due to which setting an actor's `send_retries: 0` led to infinite
  re-sending if the actor didn't respond as expected.
* Fixed a race condition between `Mark.OVERLAY` and re-scheduling timers. (#35)

### Changed
* The `Skip` expression result type has been renamed to `Next`, which better describes
  its purpose.
* The behaviour of the `OVERLAY_REVERT_ON_NO_RESULT` result marker now is the
  default with `OVERLAY`. The marker will be removed.

### Deprecated
* 0.7: The previous name `Skip` for the `Next` expression result type will be removed.
* 0.7: The `OVERLAY_REVERT_ON_NO_RESULT` marker will be removed, it's the default now.

### Removed
* The ``end_plus_days`` rule parameter has been removed in favor of the new day
  shifts specified with ``start`` and ``end``.
* The ``expression_modules`` setting has been removed in favor of the new
  ``expression_environment``.


## 0.5.0 - 2019-07-20

### Fixed
* Fixed a bug in schedule.next_results() expression helper that caused some result
  changes to be skipped.
* Simplified the algorithm that decides whether a rule is active or not at a given
  point in time. It should now handle all rules spanning multiple days correctly.

### Added
* Added ``expression_environment`` setting which allows providing arbitrary variables
  for the expression evaluation environment.

### Changed
* The ``start`` and ``end`` rule parameters now accept day shifts, deprecating the
  former ``end_plus_days``.
* Constraints of rules with a sub-schedule attached are now only validated for the
  day at which a particular rule starts. Hence rules of such sub-schedules spanning
  midnight will now run until they're intended to end.
* Home Assistant 0.96 introduced breaking changes in the climate API. Operation
  modes have been renamed into HVAC modes, which is why the thermostat actor settings
  for operation modes now have new names. See the actor docs for details.

### Deprecated
* 0.6: The ``end_plus_days`` rule parameter will be removed in favor of the new day
  shifts specified with ``start`` and ``end``.
* 0.6: The ``expression_modules`` setting will be removed in favor of the new
  ``expression_environment``.

### Removed
* Some settings of the thermostat actor have been removed in one run with the
  adaptations needed to support the new climate API of Home Assistant 0.96.


## 0.4.0 - 2019-02-24

### Fixed
* Fixed name of ``value_parameter`` setting for generic actor in docs.
* Schedules were re-evaluated when the value of a not watched attribute
  of a watched entity changes.

### Added
* Added new result marker ``OVERLAY_REVERT_ON_NO_RESULT`` to cancel an
  overlay when the schedule produces no result.
* Result markers can now be added by postprocessors as well.
* The generic actor has received new features (short values and sending
  of attributes in reversed order). See the actor sample config for details.

### Changed
* The wanted value of a room is not sent to actors at startup when
  ``replicate_changes`` has been disabled in the room's configuration.

### Removed
* The old name ``schedy_reschedule`` for the ``schedy_reevaluate``
  event has been removed.


## 0.3.0 - 2019-01-05

### Fixed
* It's no longer possible to create cycles when including schedules. The
  backwards resolution of rule values still works, it just treats
  ``IncludeSchedule()`` results for schedules already on the stack as
  if they were ``Inherit()`` and hence ignores them.
* The ``filter_entities()`` state helper returned no entities in certain
  cases.

### Added
* Schedy can now re-evaluate schedules automatically when the state of
  entities changes. See the new ``watched_entities`` settings.
* Range specifications for constraints can now be inverted by prepending
  them with ``!``.
* Added the ``Inherit()`` result type to inherit the parent rule's
  value. ``None`` will continue to work as well, but ``Inherit()``
  is more explanatory and thus preferred.
* When an expression fails to evaluate, the traceback is now logged.

### Changed
* Various small improvements of the examples for using expressions.
* The ``schedy_reschedule`` event has been renamed to
  ``schedy_reevaluate``. The old name will cease to work in version 0.4.
* The documentation for writing schedules has been restructured.

### Deprecated
* 0.4: The old name ``schedy_reschedule`` for the ``schedy_reevaluate``
  event will be removed.

### Removed
* The old name ``Negate`` for the ``Invert`` postprocessor has been
  removed.
* The ``And`` and ``Or`` postprocessors habe been removed. Use the generic
  ``Postprocess`` instead.


## 0.2.0 - 2018-12-23

**Merry Christmas to all users of hass-apps! Thank you for putting your
trust in Schedy.**

### Fixed
* All expressions of schedule rules specified in the YAML configuration
  should be enclosed in quotes to force the parser to treat them as
  strings. A note has been added to the documentation and all examples
  were updated accordingly.

### Added
* Added the ``Postprocess`` postprocessor that can be used to post-process
  the scheduling result in a completely custom way.

### Changed
* The rules configured as ``schedule_prepend``, the individual room's
  schedule and those configured as ``schedule_append`` are now combined
  into the final room's schedule as three separate sub-schedules. This
  implies that ``Break()``, when returned from the top level, will
  now only break the individual section of the schedule it stands
  in. ``Break()`` in a ``schedule_prepend`` section will e.g. only cause
  the remaining rules of the ``schedule_prepend`` section to be skipped
  and continue with the individual room's schedule. Use ``Abort()``
  (recommended) or ``Break(2)`` to achieve the old behaviour.
* The generic actor has been reworked to support controlling multiple
  attributes at once. Its configuration schema has changed as well, so
  please consult the documentation for migrating.
* Preliminary results are now called postprocessors. Syntax and names
  stay unchanged.
* The ``Negate`` postprocessor has been renamed to ``Invert``. The old
  name will cease to work in version 0.3.

### Deprecated
* 0.3: The old name ``Negate`` for the ``Invert`` postprocessor will
  be removed.
* 0.3: The ``And`` and ``Or`` postprocessors will be removed. Use the
  generic ``Postprocess`` instead.


## 0.1.1 - 2018-12-11

### Changed
* Lowered delay after which a schedy_reschedule event is processed from
  3 to 1 second.


## 0.1.0 - 2018-12-09

### Added
* Initial release.
